Student Management System

Description
This repository demonstrates a Java JDBC-based Student Management System designed specifically for PostgreSQL.
It highlights how to leverage PostgreSQL's powerful features, combined with JDBC,
to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a students table in the database.

The project provides a complete guide to implementing a robust PostgreSQL-backed database application,
including schema creation, connection handling, and parameterized SQL queries.

Key Features
PostgreSQL Integration:
Built specifically to showcase PostgreSQL as the database engine.
It uses PostgreSQL's features like SERIAL for auto-incrementing primary keys and data validation using constraints.

CRUD Operations:

Create: Add new student records.
Read: Fetch individual or all student records.
Update: Modify existing records using id.
Delete: Remove records safely by ID.
